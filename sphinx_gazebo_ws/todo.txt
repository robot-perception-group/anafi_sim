Include PID baseline to compare with stop and go PID baseline from parrot
Rewrite interface to use proper interface as described on parrot website
Include yaw in MPC to become independent of pid packages and to have unified control solution
Write test trajectory generator
    Drone starts at origin of trajectory
    trajectory is a rectilinear periodic movement in all three dimension with increasing angular frequency
    Determine tracking error, i.e. control error
    Plot angular freqeuncy, control error in x,y,z.yaw.vx,vy,vz and compare with other control approaches
    Compare also with waypoint controller from parrot

    Compare static waypoint performance
